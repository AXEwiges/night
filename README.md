# Night

Night's idea is to develop an extensible task queue to support the launch of scheduled tasks and the sending and receiving of messages. 

Night hopes to build on distributed logic to meet the deployment requirements of complex tasks, such as providing execution capabilities for database instructions and script instructions that need to be updated regularly.

Currently, as a personal project, the current development is still in the alpha stage and the functions have not been fully tested.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Task Execution
- [ ] Persistence
- [ ] Fine-grained Process Control
